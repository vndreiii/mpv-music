# ✨🎵 MPV Music 🎵✨

It's a dotfile that turns mpv into a beautiful, comfy music player, ngl prolly the best on Linux 💀💻!

### 🛠️ What does it do?

- 🎧 Converts mpv into a fully-featured music player.
- 🔄 Adds autoload support – when you double-click a song, it loads the entire folder as a playlist automatically. No more lonely tracks 😢.
- 🎤 Integrates with [mpv-lrc](https://github.com/guidocella/mpv-lrc) to auto-fetch synced lyrics 🎵📝.
- 💪 Further enhances auto-fetched lyrics with a custom script that autoloads lyrics with an overlay that dims the background slightly and vertically aligns the font that the user configures in the middle 🎨🔧.
- 📝 Custom rewrite of [Parranoh's](https://github.com/Parranoh/mpv-notify-send/blob/master/notify-send.lua) script to support sending notifications with embedded cover art from a file. (It doesn't replace the notification and creates a new one when you change songs for now) 📱🎨.
- 📦 Designed to be run inside Distrobox, but you can just adapt it to work outside. I'm not gonna make it work outside, sorry, I'm lazy 😅.
- ⚙️ Makes use of the [default](https://github.com/mpv-player/mpv/blob/master/etc/mpv.conf) mpv.conf with a few tweaks 🔧🔩.
- 💻 Comes with a .desktop launcher that hooks umpv and should work out of the box 📦🚀.

```sh
/bin/bash -c "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/vndreiii/mpv-music/main/install.sh)"
```

## 📁 Manual setup Instructions

### 📦 0. Setup your distrobox and mpv

Use preferably an Arch distrobox with the following packages:

```bash
mpv mpv-mpris mpv-thumbfast-git adwaita-fonts
```

Separate your home to not clutter your real home, in case you have another mpv installed like me. I made mine like this:

`distrobox create --name MPV --image archlinux:latest --home $HOME/Distroboxes/mpv`

After installing the mentioned packages, export mpv into your host distro with `distrobox-export --app mpv`.

Now we're going to modify the desktop file to suit our needs (to use umpv and to not load flags as a playlist.. which happened to me). I renamed the exported .desktop file to MPV-mpv.desktop (because I have another MPV installed on my host distro) and inside it looks like this:

```ini
[Desktop Entry]

If you would like to use mpv from a terminal, you need to alias mpv in your host to `/usr/bin/distrobox-enter -n MPV -- umpv`.

---

## 💽 Inside the distrobox

#### distrobox enter MPV (≧▽≦) that's it!

### 📥 1. Get umpv

You'll need the umpv helper script (It’s a cute little wrapper to launch mpv smartly via IPC that does magic stuff like having a single instance of MPV running all the time and redirect all new added songs to itself) 🎩🎵.

```bash
sudo wget -O /usr/local/bin/umpv https://raw.githubusercontent.com/mpv-player/mpv/refs/heads/master/TOOLS/umpv
sudo chmod +x /usr/local/bin/umpv
```

You're gonna need to modify the script slightly if you dislike it being queued next when double-clicking a new song. On line 71 (I will provide a snippet below) you have to remove `append-play` to make it play the song immediately. If you'd like for it to play the song next in queue, you can ignore this completely 🎵🔄.

```python
for f in files:
    f = f.replace("\\", "\\\\").replace('"', '\\"').replace("\n", "\\n")
    send(f'raw loadfile "{f}" append-play\n'.encode())
    👴 remove append-play it should look like this 💰
    send(f'raw loadfile "{f}" \n'.encode())
except Exception:
    print("mpv is terminating or the connection was lost.", file=sys.stderr)
    sys.exit(1)
```

### 📟️ 2. Get uosc

Follow the official instructions [here](https://github.com/tomasklaen/uosc) or use my provided [script](https://github.com/vndreiii/mpv-music?tab=readme-ov-file#-automated-install) which automates everything including getting uosc 🔧🔗.

We're gonna configure only one thing here which is adding a top bar to have buttons to minimize, maximize, close, and a title with the name of the song. First, access `$HOME/Distroboxes/mpv/.config/mpv/script-opts/uosc.conf` with any editor and search for `top_bar=`. Set it from no-border to **always**, and voilà, top bar 🎛️🔝.

### 🗳️ 3. Get the mpv.conf

Get the default mpv.conf and after that, we're gonna add some enhancements 🔧📝.

```bash
wget -O ~/.config/mpv/mpv.conf https://raw.githubusercontent.com/mpv-player/mpv/refs/heads/master/etc/mpv.conf
```

Under [Video settings] add:

```ini
geometry=650x650  # You can specify the size of the player in pixels
autofit-larger=90%x90%
keep-open=yes
osd-bar=no
force-window=yes
profile=high-quality
video-sync=display-resample
gpu-api=vulkan
hr-seek-framedrop=no
hwdec=auto-copy  # If you have issues check out https://mpv.io/manual/master/#options-hwdec for more info.
vo=gpu-next
```

Under [Audio settings] add:

```ini
volume=84  # Or whatever you want the default volume to be
volume-max=200  # Maximum volume to display and to let use access
save-position-on-quit=yes  # Or do not save it so it will always play the song from the start
audio-channels=auto
```

Under [Other settings]:

```ini
sub-font="Adwaita Sans"  # Specify the font used for the player you can check all fonts with fc-list.
sub-ass-override=yes
sub-bold=yes  # Whether to make font bold or not
sub-font-size=64  # Font size
sub-align-x=center
sub-align-y=center
sub-justify=left
sub-border-size=0.2  # Border size of the outlines
sub-blur=20  # Overall blur of the outlines
sub-shadow-offset=8  # Shadow distance (also gets affected by the outlines' blur)
sub-shadow-color="#000118"  # Shadow color
```

That's it! You have an amazing mpv configuration now. You can further tweak the conf file however you want. I recommend reading the [mpv docs](https://mpv.io/manual/master) 📖🔍.

> If double-clicking plays audio but you can't see the mpv, do not worry, the configuration for Hardware Acceleration might not work for your setup! Edit [mpv.conf](https://github.com/vndreiii/mpv-music?tab=readme-ov-file#%EF%B8%8F-3-get-the-mpvconf) located at `$HOME/Distroboxes/mpv/.config/mpv/mpv.conf` until it renders. If nothing works, remove:
>
> - `vo=gpu-next`
> - `hwdec=auto-copy`
> - `gpu-api=vulkan`
>
> Which turns off hardware acceleration as a whole ❌🔧.

### 🐧 4. Install the autoload.lua script

This makes MPV load all tracks in the folder as a playlist, which is chef’s kiss 👨‍🍳💋:

```bash
mkdir -p ~/.config/mpv/scripts  # If the folder doesn't exist
wget -O ~/.config/mpv/scripts/autoload.lua https://raw.githubusercontent.com/mpv-player/mpv/refs/heads/master/TOOLS/lua/autoload.lua
```

Create an autoload.conf file in `~/.config/mpv/script-opts/` with these settings:

```ini
disabled=no
images=no
videos=no
audio=yes
ignore_hidden=yes
same_type=no
directory_mode=recursive
ignore_patterns=^~,^bak-,%.bak$  # You can add more files to ignore here by adding %.filetype$ for files ending in said filetype or ^filetype- separated by , commas.
```

### 🎤 5. Auto Lyrics with mpv-lrc

Install the lyrics fetcher from mpv-lrc:

```bash
wget -O ~/.config/mpv/scripts/lrc.lua https://raw.githubusercontent.com/guidocella/mpv-lrc/refs/heads/main/lrc.lua
wget -O ~/.config/mpv/script-opts/lrc.conf https://raw.githubusercontent.com/guidocella/mpv-lrc/refs/heads/main/script-opts/lrc.conf
```

Boom. That’s it. Lyrics from the clouds ☁️🎵.

> To fetch the lyrics for songs that don't have them / does not fetch them, you can press Alt + M to retrieve via Musixmatch, and Alt + N via Netease (as of now the author said fetching via Netease will return random Chinese characters and pretty much useless picks so do try to use Musixmatch instead) 🎵🔍.

## 🎊 Final step: To enhance the lyrics with an overlay and make the full package work correctly

You need to clone `lyrics-toggle.lua` and `notify_cover.lua` into your `~/.config/mpv/scripts` like this:

```bash
wget -O ~/.config/mpv/scripts/lyrics-toggle.lua https://raw.githubusercontent.com/vndreiii/mpv-music/refs/heads/main/scripts/lyrics-toggle.lua
wget -O ~/.config/mpv/scripts/ https://raw.githubusercontent.com/vndreiii/mpv-music/refs/heads/main/scripts/notify_cover.lua
```

This will make the lyrics overlay work and the notifications work correctly. To toggle the lyrics overlay on or off, simply press "V" on your keyboard 🎹🔄.

> I also implemented a secondary "Shift+C" keybind in case the background image appears bugged. It will clear all filters such as the overlay 🔧🔄.

### 💡 Autohiding ".lrc" lyric files in Dolphin on KDE

Create a new `.sh` file wherever you feel like called `observe_flacs.sh`, paste this into it. It uses `inotifywait` to check for new files created and adds them to `.hidden` which Dolphin automatically ignores and hides unless you turn on "view hidden files" 📁🙈.

```bash
#!/bin/bash
# observe_flacs.sh
# This script watches whatever folder you specify for new .lrc files, (Usually the one where your music is stored)
# then appends their basename (without the .lrc extension) to .hidden in the same folder.
WATCH_DIR="/path/to/lrc/files/normally/next/to/songs/"
HIDDEN_FILE="${WATCH_DIR}/.hidden"
# Monitor the directory for new file creation events
inotifywait -m -e create --format '%f' "${WATCH_DIR}" | while read FILENAME; do
    # Check if the file has a .lrc extension
    if [[ "${FILENAME}" == *.lrc ]]; then
        # Append the filename (with extension) to the .hidden file
        echo "${FILENAME}" >> "${HIDDEN_FILE}"
        echo "Added '${FILENAME}' to .hidden"  # Optional: for logging/debugging
    fi
done
```

You can autostart this with a systemd service file or simply adding the `.sh` file to your xdg-autostart 🔄📁.

### 💾 Notes

You can clone `input.conf` into your mpv folder to press the Tab key and show the full UI optionally by running:

```bash
wget -O $HOME/Distroboxes/mpv/.config/mpv/input.conf https://raw.githubusercontent.com/vndreiii/mpv-music/refs/heads/main/input.conf
```

Make sure your MPV config is in `$HOME/Distroboxes/mpv/.config/mpv/mpv.conf` (otherwise it might not work, I'm not really sure what could happen) 🤷‍♂️💾.

Idk what I'm doing and it's probably overcomplicated. Someone else might be able to implement this in an all-in-one package. I'm not that smart, so enjoy this for now 😅🎉.

For last.fm or listenbrainz, you can set up [rescrobbled](https://github.com/InputUsername/rescrobbled) with a systemd service on startup, and whitelisting `player-whitelist = [ "mpv" ]`, the rest of the setup instructions is on their repo 🎵📊.
